# Goal: 
- Write a string to memory "flag.txt"
- get that value into RDI, so that we can print the contents with print_file


# Primitives
- We can control the following registers:
 * rbx, rcx, rdx
 * rsi, edi
 * r12- r15,  
Seeing as we can only control the lower 32 bits of edi, we should seek to write to a location that's within that limit. We will use the `.dynamic` section for this.


# Approach:

this gadget is the key to our victory:
`
add BYTE [rbx], ch
`
Yes, it's small, but it's still an arbitrary write. We will populate rcx, in such a way that ch always corresponds to one char of the "flag.txt", and then we will place them inside the .dynamic section of the binary, which is writable and has plenty of space. Then, we will load this address into edi 


# Misc notes:

- `pop rdi` can be accessed by cutting a gadget (`pop r15`) in the middle, effectively transforming it.
