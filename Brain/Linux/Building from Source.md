### Building from source

Whenever I install something using pacman, I am installing a pre-compiled binary. Someone already put in the computation power needed to compile this binary, and i'm using their computation power. Since modern networks can download a binary file much faster than CPU's this is the fastest way to get a program runnign. Building from source, is compiling it on your own.

# Why should you build from SRC?
1. **Customization**: You can enable or disable specific features and optimizations tailored to your needs.
2. **Security**: Building from source allows you to inspect the code and ensure there are no hidden vulnerabilities or backdoors. Much more than that, `it allows you to confirm that you are actually installing the correct binary associated with the source code. It is trivially easily to sign a malicious binary without updating the source code.`
3. **Optimization**: You can optimize the software for your specific hardware, improving performance.
4. **Learning**: It provides insight into the softwareâ€™s structure and build process, which can be educational.
5. **Latest Features**: Access to the latest features and bug fixes that may not yet be available in precompiled binaries.
