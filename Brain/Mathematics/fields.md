# Remarks about fields

1. R is a field
2. {0} satisfies all 11 field axioms, but usually we also require that in a field, the identity element for multiplciation and addition is different for each of them.
3. Zn fields (finite fields) are fields with a finite number of elements, that utilize modulo addition to have a circular definition of addition, thereby providing closure.
