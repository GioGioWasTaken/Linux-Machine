\section{Preface}

I mainly did nothing today because I had a rough morning, but I decided I want to do something so I started another video in the Linear Algebra playlist.

After hearing censor talk a bit about polynomials I realized i don't know how the general equation for third degree polynomials looks like. The obvious solution, is to try and derive it myself :)


\section{Proof}

Let $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx^1 +d $ for some $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb R$. Then we define its roots, as a number x s.t. $P(x) =0$. We will attempt to find a general equation to find the roots of a third degree polynomial given its coeffecients.

$
ax^3 + bx^2 + cx^1 +d  = 0

ax^3 + bx^2 + cx^1 = -d

x^3 + \frac{bx^2} a + \frac{cx^1} a = \frac{-d} a
$
