\section{About}
\textit{This} will be my first proof done in Latex!


\section{The proof to be done}

Proof that ($\mathbb{Q}, +, \cdot$) is a Field 

\section{Axioms}

The set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) forms a group under addition, denoted as \((\mathbb{Z}, +)\). It is also closed under multiplication.

\section{The proof itself:}
To prove that \((\mathbb{Q}, +, \cdot)\) is a field, we will verify that the set of rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\) satisfies the field axioms under the operations of addition \(+\) and multiplication \(\cdot\), and has an identity e.

\subsection*{1. Closure}

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}$. Then $a = \frac{m}{n}$ and $b = \frac{p}{q}$, for some numbers $p,q,m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$:

\subsubsection*{Addition: }
\[
a + b = \frac{m}{n} + \frac{p}{q} = \frac{mq + np}{nq} \in \mathbb{Q}
\]
Seeing as $(\cdot,+)$ are closed under $\mathbb{Z}$. And $n,q \neq0$

\subsubsection*{Multiplication: }

Trivially the same.

\section{trivial stuff, gonna skip }

\section{Distributivity}

\subsection{Addition}
+ Distirbutes over $\cdot$ :

$
\frac{a}{b} \left(\frac{x_1}{y_1}+\frac{x_2}{y_2}\right) = \frac{a}{b} \frac{x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1}{y_1 y_2} = \frac{a \left(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1\right)}{b y_1 y_2}
$


\subsection{Multiplication}

$
\frac{a}{b} \frac{x_1}{y_1} + \frac{a}{b} \frac{x_2}{y_2} = \frac{a x_1}{b y_1} + \frac{a x_2}{b y_2} = \frac{a x_1 b y_2 + b y_1 a x_2}{b^2 y_1 y_2} = \frac{a x_1 y_2 + a y_1 x_2}{b y_1 y_2}
$

\section{maybe not so trivial}

All nonzero fractions have inverses under multiplication since if $\frac{a}{b}$  is not 0, then it has an inverse $\frac{b}{a}$. Which exists since $a\neq0$.

Overall this was really awful to write. Writing latex feels slow as shit and I  never want to do it again. Looks pretty though. $\frac{a}{b}$
