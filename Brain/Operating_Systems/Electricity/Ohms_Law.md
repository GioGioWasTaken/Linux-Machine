-  current and resistence are inversly proportional to each other. The higher the resistance the lower the current and vise-versa. (assuming the voltage is constant)

- When resistors are connected in series(as opposed to in parallal ) we sum them up to get the total resistance. 
    - in other words, resistors  placed in series are completely equivalent to a theoretical resistor with their summed up resistance.
