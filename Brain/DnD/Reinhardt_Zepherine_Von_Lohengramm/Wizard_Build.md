# Feats

## Master Of Prestidigitation :

- Can choose a spell category out of [This list](https://www.reddit.com/r/d100/) and roll for what I get.
- Can also roll a d100
- Can also expand a spell slot and choose one of them.

## Note 1
* this might be one of the most useful cantrips in the game- and it fits my use case (useless spell crazed, war crazed, former aristocrat) . Some uses this could have:


- Dangerous to start a fire (don't want to get spotted) but still need heat? (Especially for your tea) Prestidigitation.

- Bad guy swallowing poison and want to make sure he doesn't notice the taste? Prestidigitate that flavor to sweet and tasty. 

- Party member is a piece of shit? Prestidigitate his rations to taste like soured fruit. Getting swallowed by a giant toad? Prestidigitate your clothes to be way too spicy.

- Make an entrance (clothes rippling and faint music filling the air)

- hide yourself among the enemy in a pitched battle by making their insignia suddenly appear on your clothing.

-    The enemy can see you in the darkness thanks to the light of their (or your own) torch... Until you snuff that light instantly with Prestidigitation.

as one DM on reddit put it : "It does whatever wizardy thing you can do to, to make you appear wizardy, within reason."

### Point to discuss:

A variation on my initial request of the feat. This time it'll be something like  Discuss details in call.


## Note 2


### Why is this relevant to Mold Earth?

Two words: Trench warfare. This is so fucking useful. You can hide your troops. Your possessions. Your traps. Steal something and quickly hide it before anyone comes. Infinite potential when combined with my other two cantrips and my imagination!

Let's say that my character got rich by selling weapons to one political faction or something of the sort, because i'm a war obssessed narcissist that likes to collect weird spells. 

# Spells

## Level 1 spells

### Warning: I fucking love utillity spells. But I suppose I'll take some attack ones...
- Detect Magic (obvious)
- If I'm gonna be an extremely annoying piece of shit I might as well have these: (plus they are very good spells)
	- Shield
	- Mage Armor 
- Fog Cloud: eliminating opposing advantage, eliminating allied disadvantage, disrupting opponents at range, imagine if i combine it with mold earth. 
- Magic Missile (obligatory attack spells, i wanted to take `Silent Image` , might go the illusion route but oh well.)
- Sleep 	


# Custom background : 

- The DM officially promises that (within reason) I am allowed to choose 2 skills in which I will have proficiency.
- and (within reason) proficiency in 1 language of my choice.

## Equipment:

- Money: 10 GP , 7 Silver
- A Navy coloured suit with golden straps. It shines gloriously as it basks in the sun, as if Jove himself wills my overwhelming rein over the heavens
- A golden pocket watch
- Explorer's pack (and some paper!)
- Spellbook
