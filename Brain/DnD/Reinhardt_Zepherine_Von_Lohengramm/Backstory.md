## To demonstrate these traits, here are some lines:

(read with pompeous british accent)

Ah, my esteemed comrades, gather 'round and witness the future of greatness standing before you! Yes, yes, I know you are captivated by the sight of my finely-tailored attire. A masterpiece of fabric and wealth—oh, and let’s not forget the power radiating from me, though I admit, it’s difficult not to notice. Hah! Bless your hearts, you simple creatures.

Now, you may notice the occasional… ah…wear and tear on these elegant threads. Oh, don’t mistake it for poverty —hah!— but rather… adventure's toll. I cannot be bothered with such trivial matters as "replacing" garments every time I slay a beast or rescue a village! After all, I’m far too busy plotting my glorious return to wealth, which, as we all know, is simply a matter of time.

I, the one and only noble heir of fortunes (lost and to be regained) am embarking on this glorious adventure not for coin or petty fame, but for destiny. A destiny that will see my name etched into the annals of history, for generations to tremble before!

I can already hear the whispers of astonishment when I walk into the finest establishments, dressed in splendor that even royalty would envy. "But sir, we do not accept buttons and pocket lint as payment," they say! Hah! How amusing that they expect such things from me, an aristocrat among peasants! Truly, they do not understand that money will soon flood my coffers, washing away their petty concerns.

Do you think gold will deny me? Do you think spells and mysteries would dare hide from me? Oh, how foolish! Hah! The very world itself knows that I am its master, waiting for my triumphant return to claim what is rightfully mine!

Oh, and did I mention my magical prowess? Of course, you are aware. Look at this spell! [Flourishes hands dramatically] A simple one, yes, just a… window-cleaning enchantment. Oh, but observe the precision! the elegance! Do you see the artistry in the weave of magic? Oh, how it sparkles in the light! You’re not looking close enough; none of you ever do. I hear you people muttering things like, "Perhaps you should prioritize… more practical magic, like conjuring food." Hah! Such small minds! How could they possibly understand that a true noble focuses on art, not sustenance!

Why, just last week, I graced the finest tavern with my presence—of course they recognized me on sight. I placed my order: roasted pheasant, rare wine, the works! It wasn’t until they asked for payment that they seemed to, ah, misunderstand my situation. "Sir, perhaps you have misplaced your wallet again?" How quaint! As if I would be so careless! I merely told them to add it to my immense tab, which, I assure you, is an investment they will cherish once I restore my fortunes!

And who could forget the delightful moment when I entered the grand bazaar, eyeing the finest magical tomes, only to be told, "Sir, perhaps you'd like to try something in your price range... over there... by the discount potions?" [laugh] As if I—I—would stoop so low! Please! Those merchants will be begging me to return once my inevitable rise to power is complete. The riches of kingdoms will be at my fingertips soon enough.

So, comrades, fear not! Though the world may tremble at the thought of me, ah, "struggling," it’s merely a temporary misunderstanding. For soon, we shall bask in the riches I am destined to reclaim! And when I do, I shall dine like a king, dressed like an emperor, and I might even throw a coin or two to those who doubted me.

Now, onward! To glory! To victory! And to the inevitable restoration of my vast fortunes! [Loud, hearty laughter that drowns out the sounds of a grumbling stomach]



# Backstory
Once, Reinhardt Zepherine Von Lohengramm was known as 'The Prodigy of the Arcane Court'. Born into a house revered for its mastery of destructive and combative magic, he was expected to follow in the footsteps of his ancestors, who led armies with flames and lightning at their fingertips. Reinhardt, however, had a different vision of greatness. While his family valued might and power, Reinhardt was entranced by the more eccentric aspects of magic—spells no one ever bothered with, seemingly trivial, useless to most… but fascinating to him.

(changing tone here)

Born into a house of so-called "masters" of destructive magic, I was expected to follow their brutish footsteps. Lead armies with flames and lightning, they said! Hah! As if I would stoop to such mundane pursuits.

In my youth, while lesser minds busied themselves with explosions and lightning bolts, I delved into the secrets of real power. Spells to make my hair glisten under moonlight! Enchantments to perfectly align the stars in my bathwater! Magic to summon a breeze that would lift my cape dramatically upon entering a room! Oh, the expressions on my parents' faces—priceless!

"Why would you learn this drivel when you could master the arcane arts of war?" they'd ask. To which I, of course, replied with a chuckle and a wave of my hand, "Pshaw, esteemed father! Anyone can blow up a tower. It takes true talent to summon a perfectly chilled goblet of wine."

Now, picture if you will, my coming-of-age ceremony. The Arcane Court gathered, expecting some dreary display of destruction. Instead, I gifted them with true magic! An illusion that transformed their dull chamber into a wonderland of refinement! Dancing teacups! Self-playing instruments! "Behold!" I proclaimed, "True magic isn't about puny explosions, but about elegance and refinement!"

Some were enchanted, others appalled—clearly, their simple minds couldn't grasp my genius. And my family? Oh, they were beside themselves! My father, face as red as a tomato, had the audacity to cast me out! "If you wish to squander your talents on parlor tricks, you shall do so without the backing of this house!" he bellowed.

But did I falter? Did I cower? Hah! Perish the thought! I declared, "You'll see! I shall build an empire of elegance and wonder that will make our family's brutal magic look positively barbaric!"
