I am advanturing to retrieve my lost wealth, to spread my name under the heavens in great glory with good comrades, and of course, to collect magic.


## To demonstrate these traits, here are some lines:

(read with pompeous british accent)

Ah, my esteemed comrades, gather 'round and witness the future of greatness standing before you! Yes, yes, I know you are captivated by the sight of my finely-tailored attire. A masterpiece of fabric and wealth—oh, and let’s not forget the power radiating from me, though I admit, it’s difficult not to notice. Hah! Bless your hearts, you simple creatures.

Now, you may notice the occasional… ah…wear and tear on these elegant threads. Oh, don’t mistake it for poverty —hah!— but rather, adventure's toll. I cannot be bothered with such trivial matters as "replacing" garments every time I slay a beast or rescue a village! After all, I’m far too busy plotting my glorious return to wealth, which, as we all know, is simply a matter of time.

I, the one and only noble heir of fortunes (lost and to be regained) am embarking on this glorious adventure not for coin or petty fame, but for destiny. A destiny that will see my name etched into the annals of history, for generations to tremble before!

I can already hear the whispers of astonishment when I walk into the finest establishments, dressed in splendor that even royalty would envy. "But sir, we do not accept buttons and pocket lint as payment," they say! Hah! How amusing that they expect such things from me, an aristocrat among peasants! Truly, they do not understand that money will soon flood my coffers, washing away their petty concerns.

Do you think gold will deny me? Do you think spells and mysteries would dare hide from me? Oh, how foolish! Hah! The very world itself knows that I am its master, waiting for my triumphant return to claim what is rightfully mine!

Oh, and did I mention my magical prowess? Of course, you are aware. Look at this spell! [Flourishes hands dramatically] A simple one, yes, just a… window-cleaning enchantment. Oh, but observe the precision! the elegance! Do you see the artistry in the weave of magic? Oh, how it sparkles in the light! You’re not looking close enough; none of you ever do. I hear you people muttering things like, "Perhaps you should prioritize… more practical magic, like conjuring food." Hah! Such small minds! How could they possibly understand that a true noble focuses on art, not sustenance!

Why, just last week, I graced the finest tavern with my presence—of course they recognized me on sight. I placed my order: roasted pheasant, rare wine, the works! It wasn’t until they asked for payment that they seemed to, ah, misunderstand my situation. "Sir, perhaps you have misplaced your wallet again?" How quaint! As if I would be so careless! I merely told them to add it to my immense tab, which, I assure you, is an investment they will cherish once I restore my fortunes!

And who could forget the delightful moment when I entered the grand bazaar, eyeing the finest magical tomes, only to be told, "Sir, perhaps you'd like to try something in your price range... over there... by the discount potions?" [laugh] As if I—I—would stoop so low! Please! Those merchants will be begging me to return once my inevitable rise to power is complete. The riches of kingdoms will be at my fingertips soon enough.

The riches of kingdoms will be at my fingertips soon enough.


So, comrades, fear not! Though the world may tremble at the thought of me, ah, "struggling," it’s merely a temporary misunderstanding. For soon, we shall bask in the riches I am destined to reclaim! And when I do, I shall dine like a king, dressed like an emperor, and I might even throw a coin or two to those who doubted me.

Now, onward! To glory! To victory! And to the inevitable restoration of my vast fortunes! [Loud, hearty laughter that drowns out the sounds of a grumbling stomach]
