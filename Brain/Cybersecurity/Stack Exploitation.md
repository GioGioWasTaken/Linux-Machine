- There are several very commonly used buffer overflow mitigations. Here is a short description of them:
	- [NX](NX) 
	- [RELRO](RELRO) 
    - [ASLR](ASLR) 
    - [PIE](PIE)
- [[ROP]] is a very useful technique to bypass all kinds of data execution preventation mitigations. 
- A perfectly good attack might still end in a segfault due to stack alignment. In assembly, the OS expects ESP to end in specific values. This can be beat by chaining a return addresses into the payload, before the target address.
