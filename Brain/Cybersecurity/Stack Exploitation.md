- In order to exploit the stack, one must intimately understand [[Assembly and RE]].
- There are several very commonly used buffer overflow mitigations. Here is a short description of them:
	- [NX](NX) 
	- [RELRO](RELRO) 
    - [ASLR](ASLR) 
    - [PIE](PIE.md)
- [[ROP]] is a very useful technique to bypass all kinds of data execution preventation mitigations. 
- A perfectly good attack might still end in a segfault due to faulty stack alignment. More at [[Assembly and RE]]  
- In situations where the buffer isn't large enough to store shellcode, but the stack is still executable, we can store shellcode inside env variables, and locate their offset from ESP, seeing as they are stored on the stack.
