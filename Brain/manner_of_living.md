# Inner-Outer
My influence over the outside world. 


Before you speak ask yourself:
    - is it true?
    - is it necessary?
    - is it kind?

# Outer-inner
The influence of the outside world over me. 

- Do not fawn over clapping of hands.
- Nor over clapping of tongues, which is in essence identical to clapping of hands.



# Inner-Inner
My influence over me.

- Do not get trapped in your own ego.
   -  Self tranquility achieved by means of looking down on others is both fake and not worth achieving.
   -  If you think it is better to do x, but judge those who choose to do y, you are trapped in your own ego.

## Emotion
- If you are sad, cry.
- If you are happy, smile.
- if you are drowning in annui, or lack inspiration, go outside, reduce screen time, and remember that completely isolated existence is by design opposed to nature, and that which is not according to nature is an evil to you.

## Work Ethic
- If you do not want to work after having worked, then take a breath. Rest. 
- If you do not want to work, simply out of your own laziness, ask yourself if you were made to rot in bed.

[!QUOTE] Marcus aurelius once said:
```
"In the morning, when thou risest unwillingly, let this thought be present: I am rising to the work of a human being. Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world? Or have I been made for this, to lie in the bedclothes and keep myself warm?

But this is more pleasant.

Dost thou exist then to take thy pleasure, and not at all for action or exertion? Dost thou not see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees, working together to put in order their several parts of the universe? And art thou unwilling to do the work of a human being, and dost thou not make haste to do that which is according to thy nature?

But it is necessary to take rest also.

It is necessary; however, nature has fixed bounds to this too: she has fixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet thou goest beyond these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in thy acts it is not so, but thou stoppest short of what thou canst do."

## Thoughts on art

Art: A mode of creating, that has no regard for efficiency or any utilitarian need, but does something, out of the reason, and soley out of the reason, that it is beautiful. Anything that can be done beautifully is art, and all art is useless and must be useless.
