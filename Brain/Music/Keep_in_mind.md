# What is this?

A collection of tips I've heard in videos or read about in articles, that stroke me as important.



## Always listen to what you're playing! Don't focus only on the fingering.


## Get used to the lingo
 - When thinking of a finger to play with, rather then thinking "ring" think of the number 4, same for the other fingers.

## On playing in different keys:

It is beneficial to identify a note by its position in each key(scale). The reason is that frequently notes of the same index serve the same roles in different keys. For example the 2nd note of the C major scale, and the 2nd note of the G major scale, will often be utilized in a similar way, so its beneficial for pattern recognition to take note of that.

Instead of thinking of notes absolutely (C, D, E, etc.), you think of them relatively within a key.

### Why?

- Patterns Across Keys – The 2nd note (or supertonic) in C major (D) and in G major (A) often plays a similar melodic or harmonic role. This makes it easier to transpose melodies and recognize common structures.

- Chord Functions Stay Consistent – The 5th note (or dominant) always creates tension that resolves to the 1st note (tonic), whether it’s G → C in C major or D → G in G major.

- Improvisation & Composition – If you know that the 3rd degree of a major scale gives the chord its "major" quality, you can apply that knowledge in any key.

## When pressing the keys keep this in mind!!!!

 *You need to transfer your weight between fingers to help you with forearm rotation!!!!!*

Try this: stand with feet hip width apart, with your weight evenly distributed on both feet. If you want to stand on your right foot only, you have to transfer your weight to your right foot. Feel the shift through your body to your right foot. You don't even have to lift up your left food to feel the transfer of weight. Transfer your weight to your left foot and feel the same thing.

Now apply this idea to your fingers on the piano. *You're not "pressing" on the keys, you are using your weight to make the key go down*. The action is originating from your forearm, not your wrist, hand, or fingers. Think of your arm, wrist, hands and finger as all one unit. So I don't think that thinking of your arm as a noodle with weights on the end of each finger is the way to go.

## Whole step in notation:
 a whole step on the piano, is equivalent to going up one stave on the music sheet, in the cases of e, or b, it will be followed by a # symbol, since a whole step will reach a black key. Whether or not it will actually be a # or a flat, just depends on the key.




# Common mistakes to avoid:


I think there are a few ways one can "recognize a I->V". You can recognize it by seeing it in sheet music, and this is kind of a basic comprehension issue. It's the equivalent to reading a paragraph of text by recognizing that it's broken up into sentences.

Newbies tend to see "okay I play C E G, then I play B D G". An experience player sees "I root position, V first inversion" just at a glance. This allows the experienced player to see "E G# B followed by D# F# B" as the exact same thing as "C E G followed by B D G". The real key (no pun intended!) is seeing that the notes themselves don't matter at all. It's all about the relationship between the notes

And then there's recognizing I->V by sound, or knowing what that FEELS like and how to express that correctly. Or, more generally, knowing that a song is structured as a pattern of chords. Those chords may be super obvious or they may be obfuscated. This also helps because it's like being able to understand punctuation in written language. The analogy isn't perfect but a chord progression produces a kind of cadence, just like commas, semi-colons, quotes, and periods create a cadence in written language.

A very experienced musician might hear a bass line that goes "Do Ti La" and they'll feel a I V vi (as one possible interpretation). This allows for quicker processing, and deeper understanding of the music.
I cannot believe that no one mentioned breathing. You need to remember to breathe. Most people, even trained in piano for years forget to breathe and usually for the teacher it's an easy fix for a lot of tension based issue in ur back and arms and fingers. Breathing fixes a lot of muscular issues and back issues. Read, or re-read "Effortless Mastery" by you know who... He'll set you straight.

Another big issues was flat fingers. Huge issues in actually getting to grips with a piece when your hand control is off the wall. You aren't just pressing buttons, you are pushing your sense of time and musicality into the piece, this cannot be achieved with flat fingers. Hanon excercises I have found deal with that issue quite quickly, so long as they maintain the curved fingers throughout and at a slow tempo.

The biggest mistake I've seen adult students make is thinking that they play piano with your fingers.

Think about it this way: do you bowl with your fingers, or with your arms and shoulders? Piano is very similar. Your fingers happen to be in contact with the keys, but the real work comes from your shoulders, arms and wrists to direct your arm weight into the keys.

Virtuosity is comfort. Playing the piano very well is much less strenuous than beginners seem to think it should be.

So if I could give one piece of advice, it would be to constantly check your wrists. They should NEVER be locked up, they should always be able to move up and down freely anytime you're playing
