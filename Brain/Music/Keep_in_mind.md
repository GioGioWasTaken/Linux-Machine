# What is this?

A collection of tips I've heard in videos or read about in articles, that stroke me as important.



## Always listen to what you're playing! Don't focus only on the fingering.


## Get used to the lingo
 - When thinking of a finger to play with, rather then thinking "ring" think of the number 4, same for the other fingers.

## On playing in different keys:

It is beneficial to identify a note by its position in each key. The reason is that frequently notes of the same index serve the same roles in different keys. For example the 2nd note of the C major scale, and the 2nd note of the G major scale, will often be utilized in a similar way, so its beneficial for pattern recognition to take note of that.

Instead of thinking of notes absolutely (C, D, E, etc.), you think of them relatively within a key.

### Why?

- Patterns Across Keys – The 2nd note (or supertonic) in C major (D) and in G major (A) often plays a similar melodic or harmonic role. This makes it easier to transpose melodies and recognize common structures.

- Chord Functions Stay Consistent – The 5th note (or dominant) always creates tension that resolves to the 1st note (tonic), whether it’s G → C in C major or D → G in G major.

- Improvisation & Composition – If you know that the 3rd degree of a major scale gives the chord its "major" quality, you can apply that knowledge in any key.
