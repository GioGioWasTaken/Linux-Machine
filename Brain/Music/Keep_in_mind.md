# What is this?

A collection of tips I've heard in videos or read about in articles, that stroke me as important.



## Always listen to what you're playing! Don't focus only on the fingering.


## Get used to the lingo
 - When thinking of a finger to play with, rather then thinking "ring" think of the number 4, same for the other fingers.

## On playing in different keys:

It is beneficial to identify a note by its position in each key(scale). The reason is that frequently notes of the same index serve the same roles in different keys. For example the 2nd note of the C major scale, and the 2nd note of the G major scale, will often be utilized in a similar way, so its beneficial for pattern recognition to take note of that.

Instead of thinking of notes absolutely (C, D, E, etc.), you think of them relatively within a key.

### Why?

- Patterns Across Keys – The 2nd note (or supertonic) in C major (D) and in G major (A) often plays a similar melodic or harmonic role. This makes it easier to transpose melodies and recognize common structures.

- Chord Functions Stay Consistent – The 5th note (or dominant) always creates tension that resolves to the 1st note (tonic), whether it’s G → C in C major or D → G in G major.

- Improvisation & Composition – If you know that the 3rd degree of a major scale gives the chord its "major" quality, you can apply that knowledge in any key.

## When pressing the keys keep this in mind!!!!

 *You need to transfer your weight between fingers to help you with forearm rotation!!!!!*

Try this: stand with feet hip width apart, with your weight evenly distributed on both feet. If you want to stand on your right foot only, you have to transfer your weight to your right foot. Feel the shift through your body to your right foot. You don't even have to lift up your left food to feel the transfer of weight. Transfer your weight to your left foot and feel the same thing.

Now apply this idea to your fingers on the piano. *You're not "pressing" on the keys, you are using your weight to make the key go down*. The action is originating from your forearm, not your wrist, hand, or fingers. Think of your arm, wrist, hands and finger as all one unit. So I don't think that thinking of your arm as a noodle with weights on the end of each finger is the way to go.

## Whole step in notation:
a whole step on the piano, is equivalent to going up one stave on the music sheet, in the cases of e, or b, it will be followed by a # symbol, since a whole step will reach a black key.
