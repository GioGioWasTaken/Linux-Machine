# What is this?

Here I will detail my approach for learning piano. This file will constatnly change to my include latest techniques and findings.


## It starts with immersion

Like all of my endeavours ever since learning Japanese, I will start by intensly immersing myself in the world of the piano. This is through constant watching and reading of all that relates to it. Listening to more piano pieces. Making my day revolve around it. This not only helps make motivation a constant invariable fact, but also signals to the brain that whatever I do learn, is essential and not to be thrown away.

Intense immersion has the sideffect of getting depressed when having to go on breaks, and feeling pressure, but I find it significantly better than the absolute state of torpor I bring myself to when not being immersed in learning of some kind. I will try being mindful, though.

So:

- Watch a lot of youtube videos about piano playing.
- Read articles
- Listen to a lot of piano music


## Daily schedule:

* this is a WIP

### A lot of technical practice: (anki equivalent)

Hours of intense technical practice (scales, arpeggios, exercises like Hanon).


In my head, this is like anki. Learn words, learn kanji, reinforce them in your head (hands in this case), so that when you encounter them in immersion(playing songs) you will flourish.

practice that's Only technical will not bring you very far and will be very very demotivating. But just the right amount of "anki", will make "immersion" significantly more fun.


###  Immersion(repertoire practice):

Like I said before, this is where the real learning happens(from what I currently know about learning anything). Breaking pieces that i want to play into smaller chunks, and minimizing my mistakes. 

- In order to maximise a positive feedback loop (play correct and your muscles will get used to playing correct), it is essential that i stop before playing mistakes, that I play slow at first, prioritising accuracy over speed. 
    * think of this like gradient descent. The cost function is stopping to play, and it tunes your muscles slowly to not repeat those movements which make you stop playing.



### Injury prevention


Unlike Japanese, or mathematics, piano practice is physical. Overdoing it can lead to catastrophic results, and injury. That's not to say I can't practice as much as I like, but I must be careful about it.

- Incoreperate breaks every 30-60 minutes of playing (depending on the intensity of play).
- Stretch before and after every practice session
