Pro tip: any MIDI file can be turned into sheet music using the right program. In that regard, google "MIDI archive" or "MIDI <song you are looking for>".

This works well for old video game music. http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/h5qo8/whats_the_best_midi_program_out_there/

You could also try to find it via Google. Type "filetype:pdf <song name> sheet music" or something similar. http://www.marcandangel.com/2006/10/13/turn-google-into-napster-2000/
