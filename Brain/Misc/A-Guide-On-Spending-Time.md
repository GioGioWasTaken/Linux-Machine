Perhaps to be published in personal site one day, let this be the first article and the How-To-Not-Go-Completely-Insane series. Well, let's continue.


## A familiar situation: 

picture this, if you will. You are on summer vacation. You worked hard all year, and you are very excited to spend your time doing ONLY things you enjoy. This is your you-time. Spend it doing whatever you may like! No work! No doing anything you don't want to do, even slightly! 

So you watch a show. And another. And another. And maybe play a video game, or read a book, or listen to songs, or watch musicals. And you repeat this. And you are enjoying it. And you are doing it out of habit. And you are doing it because you don't know what you would do otherwise. And you are no longer enjoying it. And you need to strategically place meet ups with friends in order that you don't go completely insane from doing it. Why? Why do you no longer enjoy , well, the things you enjoy? why do hobbies turn into chores and why do you feel like you are rotting in your house? 

I, at least, have experienced this phenemonon a lot of times. Enough times, in fact, to write this document. I call this House-Rot.  


## House-Rot: 

A state, typically brought on periods of vacation, caused by an overdose of watching shows, reading books, or partaking in any kind of "enjoyful" activity, since the moment one wakes up, for hours on end. 

By doing said activities without any kind of productive action before them, one will lose a sense of purpose for the rest of the day, and would no longer have the mental capcity to enjoy these activities, or to do anything productive.

Prolonged periods of House-Rot will drain your energy out of doing anything that requires an actual amount of effort.

## Meaningful persuit:

Start each day with some sort of productive, meaningful activity. Preferrably one that would take at least 4-8 hours.
this is a necessary requirement to lead a happy life in general. One needs something one can continually improve at, or gain some sort of satisfaction from accomplishing, with the task being something difficult. This will be coined meaningful-persuit. You can, of course, take breaks. Watch an episode in the middle of it. But your first part of the day must be centered around this thing, whatever it may be. This thing doesn't have do be related to your field of study or work. You can do something completely different.

So long as:
- it's difficult
- brings you a sense of accomplishment 
- and you can improved in it (thus gain either mental benefit, or material benefit if it **is** a job)

then all conditions are fulfilled.

# Rules to prevent House-Rot:
1. Partake in a meaningful persuit. Every single day. Even if you don't want to.
2. Do not take vacation time as a reason to spend all day partaking in luxary.
3. Do not start the fun activities (make your time be completely centered around them, rather then those things being 30 minutes - 1 hour ish breaks) until you approach the end of the day.
4. Do not spend the entire day with your meaningful persuit. Burn out is a very dangerous thing, and it will come if you overdue it. The goal is to prevent both burnout, and House-Rot, at the same time.
5. Meet up with friends either way. Going out to do anything will reset House-Rot for that day.
6. If you are on vacation, it's perfectly fine to have a day or two where you are only partaking in pleasureful activities. But don't let it be become a habit, lest you want to be consumed by them and fall into House-Rot.


This is all the rules I found for dealing with long periods of vacation without going insane.
