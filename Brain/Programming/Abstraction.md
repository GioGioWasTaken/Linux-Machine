The mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is the maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas and not material. 

All mathematics are built on the principle that if and only if a statement is always true, then X. If X, then Y.

The programmer is the master of abstraction. The programmer hates futility and he therefore builds castles on top of castles. 

The programmer is a mathematician, that had the gall to commit the blasphemous act of building castles on top of a physical and not purely logical object.

The digital world is an extension of the natural world. It exists only as a mathematical idea. 

All computer programs are truly nothing more than mathematical objects.

Programming is an experiment in taking a logical tour of a system from state A to B. Whether a system is electrical or not is of little importance.

It is the art of the programmer to understand a problem and strip it down to its most basic components. 

A programmer must understand a system in a perfect manner to truly computerize it.

Ah and even so, it executes.

Computer Programming is truly a profane act.


# Abstraction as it is in programming
 A language is expressive if its syntax is designed to express the problem domain it is trying to solve.

- Logic gates abstract away the details of `CMOS`.
-  Machine language abstracts away the details of logic gates.
-  Assembly language abstracts away the details of machine languages.
-  Programming language abstracts away the details of assembly languages.


## The process of abstraction:
- A lower layer has a recurring pattern. Then, this recurring pattern is
taken out and built a language on top of it.
-  A higher layer strips away layer-specific (non-recurring) details to focus on the recurring details.
- The recurring details are given a new and simpler language than the
languages of the lower layers.



* CMOS = `complementary metal-oxide semiconductor `, circuits.


Logic Gates hide the language of circuits and focuses on how to im-
plement primitive Boolean functions and combine them to create new
functions. All logic gates receive input and generate output as binary
numbers. Thanks to this recurring patterns, logic gates are hidden away
for the new language: Assembly, which is a set of predefined binary
patterns that cause the underlying gates to perform an action
