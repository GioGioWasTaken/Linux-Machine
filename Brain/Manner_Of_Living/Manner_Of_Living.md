# What is this?

My set of core rules / values that I strive to use, and lead my life following these principles.


# Inner-Outer
My influence over the outside world. 


- Before you speak ask yourself:
    * is it true?
    * is it necessary?
    * is it kind?

# Outer-inner
The influence of the outside world over me. 

- Do not fawn over clapping of hands.
- Nor over clapping of tongues, which is in essence identical to clapping of hands.



# Inner-Inner

My influence over me.

- ## Ego
   * Do not get trapped in your own ego.
      + Self tranquility achieved by means of looking down on others is both fake and not worth achieving.
      + If you think it is better to do x, but judge those who choose to do y, feeling glad that they are not at the same level as you, instead of trying to help them, you are trapped in your own ego.

- ## Emotion
   * If you are sad, cry.
   * If you are happy, smile.
   * If you are anxious, meditate.
   * If you are in turmoil, run, and lift weights. 
   * if you are drowning in annui, or lack inspiration, go outside, reduce screen time, and remember that completely isolated existence is by design opposed to nature, and that which is not according to nature is an evil to you.

- ## Work Ethic
   - [[Work]]

- ## Thoughts on art
   * Art: A mode of creating, that has no regard for efficiency or any utilitarian need, but does something, out of the reason, and soley out of the reason, that it is beautiful. Anything that can be done beautifully is art, and all art is useless and must be useless.

- ## Meditation
   * [[Meditation]]
