# Work Ethic

- If you do not want to work after having worked, then take a breath. Rest. 
- If you do not want to work, simply out of your own laziness, ask yourself if you were made to rot in bed.

[!QUOTE] Marcus aurelius once said:
```
"In the morning, when thou risest unwillingly, let this thought be present: I am rising to the work of a human being. Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world? Or have I been made for this, to lie in the bedclothes and keep myself warm?

But this is more pleasant.

Dost thou exist then to take thy pleasure, and not at all for action or exertion? Dost thou not see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees, working together to put in order their several parts of the universe? And art thou unwilling to do the work of a human being, and dost thou not make haste to do that which is according to thy nature?

But it is necessary to take rest also.

It is necessary; however, nature has fixed bounds to this too: she has fixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet, now thou goest beyond these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in thy acts it is not so, but thou stoppest short of what thou canst do."
