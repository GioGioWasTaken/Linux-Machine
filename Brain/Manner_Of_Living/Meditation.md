# Meditation

Is the practice of being aware of the present moment. Usually achieved through focusing on something like breathing.

I do not control my thoughts. But in exchage, it is reasonable, that my thoughts do not control me.

I am but an observer to whatever happens and whatever my mind produces. Sometimes it produces wonderful things- those should materialize through [[Work]].

but more often than not it can produce anxiety and other evils- all not out of my own volition.

Unless, of course, I just observe them. Never bringing an ugly thing into existence. Act beautifully, not tampered with by anything, kind to all. That is all.
