### These have no pattern nor design to them. Simply a miscallanious collection of my thoughts.

Older generations, especially those who grew up with analog clocks, tend to estimate time in rounded chunks (e.g., 5:15 instead of 5:12) because they were trained to think in relative positions rather than exact numbers.

On an analog clock, the difference between :12 and :15 is barely noticeable at a glance—both are in the same general region (quarter-past). Their brains prioritize approximate visual cues over precise numerical readings.

This habit often carries over to digital clocks, even when precision is available, because their mental model of time is still shaped by the analog format. It’s like a built-in efficiency mechanism—estimating time quickly instead of fixating on the exact digits.
