I am bored, so naturally, I am constructing a detailed guide on how to strategically leverage 21st-century knowledge to assume kingship in 1740, by manipulating public perception, religion, and spreading propaganda to foster social cohesion and garner support for my regime, all for the purpose of using my royal status to spread science as fast as possible. 


# A thought experiment

Suppose a person was sent to the year 1740 and granted a status of kingship, what knowledge would you arm them with, if we axiomatically assumed the most moral thing to do, is to advance civlization the most? 


# Initial Assumptions & Constraints

1. Time period: 1740—this is just before the Age of Enlightenment fully blossoms, meaning science, technology, and social progress are on the cusp of major changes but still primitive.

2. Goal: Accelerating civilization using knowledge from the 21st century. We assume the axiomatic belief that advancing civilization is a moral duty and that we are atheistic but can leverage religion or propaganda for political and social control.


# Axioms and Strategy

1. Social and Political Values: We’ll adhere to liberalism, equality, and human rights (as understood today), even though these ideas are not widely accepted in the 18th century. This is very problematic because intense reform of values and culture often requires  totalitarian means. The approach must be a mixture of the two, with extreme meticulousness as to not undermine the ruler himself, until much change was already brought. 

2. Political Strategy: The ruler must be seen as a savior of civilization, needing both legitimacy and popularity. This can be achieved through clever use of religion, propaganda, and institutional reforms.

3. Most important of all, that scientific progress is the moral compass which drives human beings, and is our sole goal.


## Political Legitimacy: The Ruler’s Power

Legitimacy Through Propaganda & Religion

1. Religious Utilization: Since 1740 is a time when religion still holds great sway over the masses, we can present the ruler as divinely ordained or as an agent of God in the context of religious prophecy. This doesn’t mean the ruler needs to believe in God but should use religion to justify reforms.


Example: Frame the ruler as a messianic figure in the context of Christian doctrine (or a tailored version of it), promising to bring the Kingdom of God on Earth by advancing human knowledge and eliminating suffering. 

Divine Rights of Kings: Twist the concept to argue that the ruler has been chosen by God to lead humanity into a new golden age, but only by embracing scientific and moral progress.

The ruler will make show of his advanced, god-given knowledge, which would be otherwise impossible to have, through inventions that garner attention and things of the like. The knowledge being inexplicably advanced credits the fact this knowledge was brought upon the king by god. 


## Use of Propaganda:

Since the populace in 1740 still strongly adheres to religion and traditional values, the ruler must craft propaganda that appeals to both.

Moral Authority: Frame the ruler as a divine figure chosen to bring about a better world. Use religious texts (such as biblical passages) to justify the moral righteousness of the ruler’s actions.

Scientific Progress as Divine Will: Link the advancement of science and reason to divine will or the work of a higher power, ensuring that religious followers don’t reject progress as heresy.

Revolutionary Narrative: Create a story of historical inevitability—that the ruler is merely fulfilling the natural course of humanity’s advancement and evolution, which will eventually lead to a golden age of peace and prosperity.



### **Seizing Control of the Church (Religious and Ideological Influence)**

#### **Objective:**
To control a significant ideological and social institution like the Church will allow the ruler to influence public opinion, suppress dissent, and control how knowledge is disseminated. Historically, religious institutions held immense power over the minds of the people, and even in an intellectual regime, their influence over morality, knowledge, and political legitimacy cannot be ignored.

#### **Method:**
1. **Infiltration of Religious Hierarchy:** The ruler must appoint loyalists or sympathetic reformists into key positions within the Church. This process could involve covertly recruiting high-ranking clerics or influential theologians who are willing to reshape religious doctrines to align with the ruler’s progressive ideals.
   - For example, the ruler may identify certain low-ranking clergy who are dissatisfied with the Church’s traditionalism or who harbor radical ideas. These individuals could be elevated rapidly within the hierarchy.
   
2. **Gradual Reformation of Doctrine:** Once the ruler has strategic placement within the Church, they would initiate subtle doctrinal changes to align the Church with their scientific and intellectual agenda. This could involve reinterpreting key religious texts to allow for more progressive ideas about science, knowledge, and governance. The ruler would also encourage the production of new theological works that endorse the ruler’s philosophies.
   - Example: Rewriting theological texts or encouraging scholars to reinterpret Creationism through the lens of scientific progress, presenting the ruler’s empire as divinely chosen to bring forth enlightenment to the world.

3. **Control Over Religious Narrative:** The ruler must utilize the Church’s vast infrastructure to spread favorable narratives. Sermons, religious festivals, and public appearances could be leveraged to subtly implant ideas that the ruler is a divinely appointed leader meant to bring knowledge and innovation to society.
   - Example: The Church could announce that the ruler has been chosen by a higher power to lead the world into a new era of enlightenment, creating a divine legitimacy for their reign.
   
4. **Suppressing Dissent Using Religious Authority:** Those who oppose the ruler’s regime could be branded as heretics, unholy, or enemies of divine progress. By controlling the religious apparatus, the ruler can undermine opposition by associating it with spiritual rebellion.
   - Example: Reformist or revolutionary movements that oppose the ruler could be condemned as acts of blasphemy, with dissenters excommunicated or ostracized socially.

5. **Moral Legitimacy and Obedience:** Religion provides a source of moral legitimacy. By aligning the Church with the ruler's values, the ruler can enforce a moral code that ensures obedience. The people would be encouraged to view their loyalty to the ruler as not only a civic duty but also a religious obligation.

## Political Prowess Through Bureaucracy and Diplomacy
1. Centralized Control: Establish a bureaucratic state with trained officials who can efficiently manage resources, enforce laws, and maintain order. This replaces much of the existing feudal system with meritocracy at the highest levels.

2. Use of Surveillance & Intelligence: Create an intelligence network to monitor potential threats (revolutionaries, rivals) and ensure the ruler's power remains unchallenged. Make use of informants and control key communication routes (print, letters, word-of-mouth) to influence public opinion.



This part of the guide is essentially a guide on how to establish a totalitarian state. This is awfully unintuitive for the end-goal, advancing civilization. 

The approach is essentially that of a "philosopher king". I don't have the energy to write about establishing a system of millitary meritocracy and having the millitary elite abide by the king rather then the state, but this might as well be an effective strategy if enough caution is utilized to avoid common problems with totalitrian regimes. 

## Knowledge to Share for Technological and Scientific Advancements

In order to truly advance civilization, we must focus on areas that will propel society forward in the shortest possible time. This means I need to appoint experts of each field. 


### Expanding on the Educational Strategy for Accelerating Scientific and Technological Progress

The central element of this strategy hinges on empowering a select group of exceptionally talented individuals (whom we refer to as “geniuses”) to make substantial advancements in their respective fields. This system involves providing these individuals with the foundational knowledge required to kick-start their work, but it also fosters their independence by leaving gaps for them to fill through their own discoveries and innovation.

In practice, this method is designed to create a “genius accelerator” system that accelerates technological progress across multiple domains. This approach requires meticulous planning, constant oversight, and a dynamic feedback loop to ensure that each genius progresses at a pace that contributes meaningfully to the overarching goal of accelerating civilization.

### 1. **Selection of Geniuses**

The first step in this strategy is the rigorous selection of individuals based on aptitude, intelligence, creativity, and potential for advancement in their respective fields. The selection process must identify those capable of handling advanced concepts and working independently while also possessing the discipline and drive necessary to succeed without direct guidance.

#### **Criteria for Selection:**
- **Intellectual Capacity:** A deep understanding of fundamental principles in their chosen field, paired with a natural ability to think critically and solve complex problems.
- **Creativity and Curiosity:** Individuals who demonstrate a willingness to question established norms, a propensity for abstract thinking, and the ability to imagine novel solutions to problems.
- **Work Ethic and Discipline:** Those who show consistency in their intellectual pursuits and the ability to focus on long-term goals rather than short-term rewards.
- **Communication Skills:** The ability to collaborate effectively with other experts in their field, despite operating in a system that encourages personal discovery and autonomy.

#### **Recruitment Strategy:**
- **Identifying Talent:** The ruler would deploy scouts or scholars to identify the most promising individuals in various regions, from the most prestigious universities to isolated intellectual circles. They might use specific puzzles or challenges to identify potential geniuses.
- **Training and Initial Guidance:** Once selected, the individuals would be brought to a central hub (like a scientific academy or a royal research institution) where they would undergo a period of intensive training in their field. This would involve giving them enough foundational knowledge to understand the core principles of their discipline and its potential for future progress, while also ensuring that they develop the skills to continue learning and exploring independently.

### 2. **Initial Knowledge Transfer**

The key idea behind this model is that each genius will receive just enough foundational knowledge to get started in their field. They will be given the "bare-bones facts" — high-level concepts, key experiments or discoveries, and foundational principles — but not the full, detailed methodologies or explanations.

#### **How to Ensure Adequate Knowledge Transfer:**

1. **Basic Frameworks and Core Theories:** For each domain, the ruler will prepare a “core knowledge set” that includes essential principles but avoids overwhelming the genius with excessive detail or specifics. The focus is on transmitting the most powerful and transformative concepts that will allow the genius to build upon them. 
   - **For example, in chemistry**, the ruler might provide knowledge about the atomic theory (but not the full periodic table, which would require later discoveries). They would introduce concepts such as combustion, acids, bases, and oxidation but leave the underlying atomic structures for the genius to uncover themselves.

2. **Key Milestones and Tangible Goals:** To keep the geniuses motivated and on track, they will be given specific milestones to meet within a defined timeframe. These could be goals like developing a rudimentary prototype of a steam engine, demonstrating an electrical phenomenon, or making a breakthrough in agricultural techniques. The milestones would be linked to real-world applications that are immediate and impactful.

3. **Designing Ambiguities:** While the knowledge provided should be robust, it should also intentionally leave some ambiguity — the kind of ambiguity that will drive further inquiry. The genius should be encouraged to discover the full implications of the knowledge through experimentation, further study, and insight. For example, in the case of electricity, the knowledge provided might include basic understanding of conductors and insulators, but leave out any explicit description of the relationship between electricity and magnetism, which would be a key area of discovery.

---

### 3. **Structured Time Allocation and Feedback System**

Each genius would be given a specific time period to make progress, typically ranging from several months to a few years. The ruler’s role here is to set clear expectations for each phase, ensure that each individual is making tangible progress, and maintain accountability through regular check-ins and feedback loops.

#### **Key Elements of Time Management and Feedback:**

1. **Defining the Quota:** The ruler would define clear progress quotas — quantifiable milestones that the genius must achieve within their time frame. These could include the development of prototypes, publication of a paper or theory, or a demonstration of practical application. The quotas should be ambitious but achievable, challenging the genius to push the boundaries of their field.

2. **Accountability and Assessment:** At regular intervals, the genius will present their progress to a panel of advisors (scientists, engineers, etc.) or directly to the ruler. During this assessment, the ruler and their advisors would evaluate the work based on creativity, feasibility, and potential impact. If the genius has met or exceeded the quota, they receive more resources, recognition, or opportunities to explore new avenues.

3. **Failure and Resource Allocation:** If a genius fails to meet their milestones, they will be given additional resources, guidance, or clues to help them advance. This could involve more direct access to additional knowledge, more time, or the assignment of a mentor. However, these new resources should be provided in a way that encourages independence rather than dependency, pushing the genius to find solutions themselves.

4. **Feedback Loops:** Along with direct feedback from advisors or mentors, the genius should be provided with access to a collaborative community of like-minded individuals (other geniuses, intellectuals, researchers). This would create a cross-pollination of ideas and drive collective progress.

---

### 4. **Fostering Discovery and Innovation**

While the geniuses are provided with the bare-bones knowledge, their autonomy in making discoveries is crucial. They must be guided to reach beyond what is already known and arrive at new insights through independent thinking and experimentation.

#### **Methods to Foster Discovery:**

1. **A Controlled Research Environment:** Create a collaborative research environment where the geniuses can experiment freely with materials, technologies, and concepts. The ruler could establish state-sponsored laboratories and workshops, equipped with the basic tools and instruments required for scientific inquiry. This would encourage independent experimentation while still maintaining a sense of collaboration.

2. **Allowing Room for Mistakes:** Innovation requires risk, and mistakes are an integral part of the scientific process. The system should allow room for failure and error, understanding that breakthroughs often come from trial and error. Geniuses must be encouraged to think outside the box, with failures seen as part of the learning process.

3. **Peer Interaction and Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Encourage collaboration between geniuses in different fields. For instance, a chemist may collaborate with a mechanical engineer, or a physicist may work with a biologist. This interdisciplinary approach would result in cross-field innovations, such as the early applications of chemistry to steam engine development or the use of physics in understanding biological systems.

4. **Feedback from the Ruler’s Clues:** The ruler, having deep knowledge of the general trajectory of science and technology, can act as a guiding force by dropping strategic “clues” or insights. These clues should be designed to nudge the genius in the right direction without dictating the solution. They could be in the form of provocative questions, presenting unexplored concepts, or even suggesting previously overlooked data.

---

### 5. **Creating a System that Promotes Continuous Learning and Problem-Solving**

A key issue that often slows down progress is when knowledge stagnates or when key issues remain unresolved. To avoid this, the system must ensure that learning is continuous, challenges are addressed systematically, and breakthroughs are rewarded.

#### **How to Solve the Stalemate Problem:**
1. **Creating a Knowledge Network:** Establish a network of intellectuals, scholars, and practitioners who regularly communicate findings and share discoveries. This will provide each genius with a “safety net” of expertise to draw upon when they encounter challenges. 2. **Establishing a Systematic Method for Problem-Solving:** Whenever a genius encounters a stalemate or issue they cannot overcome, they will be encouraged to document their process and share it with others. This will help identify patterns and potential solutions that could be explored further. Over time, a problem-solving methodology will emerge that integrates intuition, experimentation, and collaboration. 3. **Systematic Incentives for Discoveries:** To ensure sustained progress, the system must reward breakthrough discoveries. Geniuses who make significant strides could be granted funding for further research, land, or even titles, giving them the motivation to continue pushing boundaries. --- ### 6. **Long-Term Impact and Scaling Knowledge**

Finally, the ruler must ensure that the knowledge generated by these geniuses is not confined to a small group but is shared, scaled, and disseminated throughout the kingdom. This can be done through the establishment of educational institutions, the printing press for mass distribution of new ideas, and public demonstrations of discoveries.

#### **Ensuring Knowledge Dissemination:**

1. **Publication and Education:** Geniuses should be encouraged to publish their findings in a standardized format. This could include books, papers, or treatises that serve as educational resources for the next generation of thinkers. Schools and universities should be established to teach these new ideas.
   
2. **Public Engagement and Demonstration:** Innovations and discoveries should be presented publicly in grand demonstrations or exhibitions. These events would not only showcase the ruler's power but also promote widespread interest in science and technology, creating a culture of progress.

## Core Areas of Knowledge:

*Science & Technology:*
Steam Power: Teach the principles behind steam engines. This will lead to the Industrial Revolution decades ahead of schedule. Build a network of factories for mass production and encourage innovation in steam-powered transportation (ships, trains).

Electricity: Introduce the basics of electricity—static electricity, early understanding of conductors and insulators. This might not lead to electric power plants yet, but it will lay the foundation for an energy revolution.

Chemistry: Introduce basic principles of modern chemistry, especially alchemy's evolution into chemistry. This will lead to the Industrial Revolution in chemicals (e.g., dyes, fertilizers, medicines).

Vaccines & Medicine: Teach the principles of germ theory and introduce the first rudiments of vaccination. Basic knowledge of diseases and hygiene will save lives and establish a healthier society, which in turn leads to population growth and more productive labor.

Agriculture: Implement modern farming techniques such as crop rotation, selective breeding of livestock, and better irrigation techniques to increase food production.

*Economic Thought & System:*

This is far too complicated to be here. Economical approach is a section in and of itself that I won't write about yet.

It needs to be an intricate dance of free and expansionist markets , while still being under the intense regulation of the state.
