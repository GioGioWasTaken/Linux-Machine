# No Dragon Worth Slaying
I sit in my room and I stare at my cabin ceiling. 
It seems that I am bored. Why?
I have no purpose?

Alright than. Let's go slay a beast.

Yes, of course I am satisfied.
Look at the head of this mighty creature!

Another day passes. Perhaps the beast wasn't challenging enough.
Alright than. I shall look for great treasure.

What will I do with it?
Don't be ridiculous. Look how much gold I'll have!

And a month passes.
Ah! A dragon! of course!
So I sharpen my blade and ready my nerves.
I keep pushing. Keep hammering my steel.
And I slay the dragon.

Nothing to say this time, hah?

Oh. 
You aren't here.
