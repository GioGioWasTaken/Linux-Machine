# Stolen Night Sky

Sweet carol bells in the distance
Signal the coming of the night
And yet those clamouring city lights
show no signs of fright

Face to the sky a young boy thinks
of willows and birds and many such things

his arm outstretched
he lets out a sigh
and yet again his gaze seeks the sky

once clodded with sparkles infinite in size
now hung over his spiritless eyes

as if waiting for stars to reappear
there sits the boy
nearly in tears.
