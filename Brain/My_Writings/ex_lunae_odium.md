Once below a full-moon lit night
A young priest again preached, ah what a sight!
And Dantamiya, who beheld the scene,

And so, he brought woe upon the priest,
Into the shape of a turtle, he turned amiss.
Great Theramesius, oh so grim,

But, still feeling much sadness for the fate of his follower, he curses Tsukigami to only appear at night, in her full glory only once a month, and
