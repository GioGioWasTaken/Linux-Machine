The mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is the maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas and not material. 

All mathematics are built on the principle that if and only if a statement is always true, then X. If X, then Y.

The programmer is the master of abstraction. The programmer hates futility and he therefore builds castles on top of castles. 

The programmer is a mathematician, that had the gall to commit the blasphemous act of building castles on top of a physical and not purely logical object.

The digital world is an extension of the natural world. It exists only as a mathematical idea. 

All computer programs are truly nothing more than mathematical objects.

Programming is an experiment in taking a logical tour of a system from state A to B. Whether a system is electrical or not is of little importance.

It is the art of the programmer to understand a problem and strip it down to its most basic components. 

A programmer must understand a system in a perfect manner to truly computerize it.

Ah and even so, it executes.

Computer Programming is truly a profane act.
