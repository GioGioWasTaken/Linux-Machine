- When you hear the term word, know that it refers to the size of registers on the system in question. Thus, in 32 bit a `word` is 4 bytes, and in 64 bit, a `word` is 8 bytes. Of course, `double-word` and `quad-word` follow the same pattern.
- The theoretical limit of 32 bit, and 64 bit architectures is respectively, 2^32 and 2^64 bytes of memory.  (4GB for 32 bit.)
