# A digital computer
- Most actual digital computers have only a finite store. There is no theoretical difficulty in the idea of a computer with an unlimited store. Of course only a finite part can have been used at any one time. Likewise only a finite amount can have been constructed, but we can imagine more and more being added as required. Such computers have special theoretical interest and will be called infinitive capacity computers. 

- It is modern fantasy, that a machine must be electrical in order to work. See:
  - The idea of a digital computer is an old one. Charles Babbage, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge from 1828 to 1839, planned such a machine, called the Analytical Engine, but it was never completed. Although Babbage had all the essential ideas, his machine was not at that time such a very attractive prospect. The speed which would have been available would be definitely faster than a human computer but something like I 00 times slower than the Manchester machine, itself one of the slower of the modern machines, The storage was to be purely mechanical, using wheels and cards. The fact that Babbage's Analytical Engine was to be entirely mechanical will help us to rid ourselves of a superstition. Importance is often attached to the fact that modern digital computers are electrical, and that the nervous system also is electrical. Since Babbage's machine was not electrical, and since all digital computers are in a sense equivalent, we see that this use of electricity cannot be of theoretical importance. Of course electricity usually comes in where fast signalling is concerned, so that it is not surprising that we find it in both these connections. In the nervous system chemical phenomena are at least as important as electrical. In certain computers the storage system is mainly acoustic. The feature of using electricity is thus seen to be only a very superficial similarity. If we wish to find such similarities we should took rather for mathematical analogies of function.  
# States of a machine, and prediciting them
- It will seem that given the initial state of the machine and the input signals it is always 
possible to predict all future states, This is reminiscent of Laplace's view that from the 
complete state of the universe at one moment of time, as described by the positions and 
velocities of all particles, it should be possible to predict all future states. The prediction 
which we are considering is, however, rather nearer to practicability than that considered 
by Laplace. The system of the "universe as a whole" is such that quite small errors in the 
initial conditions can have an overwhelming effect at a later time. The displacement of a 
single electron by a billionth of a centimetre at one moment might make the difference 
between a man being killed by an avalanche a year later, or escaping. It is an essential 
property of the mechanical systems which we have called "[discrete-state machines]" that 
this phenomenon does not occur. Even when we consider the actual physical machines 
instead of the idealised machines, reasonably accurate knowledge of the state at one 
moment yields reasonably accurate knowledge any number of steps later.  
- As we have mentioned, digital computers fall within the class of discrete-state machines. 
But the number of states of which such a machine is capable is usually enormously large. 
For instance, the number for the machine now working at Manchester is about 2^165,000, 
i.e., about 10^50,000.
- For simplicity suppose that only digits from 0 to 9 are used as symbols. Variations in handwriting are ignored. Suppose 
the computer is allowed 100 sheets of paper each containing 50 lines each with room for 
30 digits. Then the number of states is 10^(100x50x30) i.e., 10^ 150,000.
- If two machines are put together their capacities must be added to obtain the capacity of the resultant machine.


# Imitating machines:
- Given the table corresponding to a discrete-state machine it is possible to predict what it 
will do. There is no reason why this calculation should not be carried out by means of a 
digital computer. Provided it could be carried out sufficiently quickly the digital 
computer could mimic the behavior of any discrete-state machine. The imitation game 
could then be played with the machine in question (as B) and the mimicking digital computer (as A) and the interrogator would be unable to distinguish them.
- This special property of digital computers, that they can mimic any discrete-state 
machine, is described by saying that they are universal machines. The existence of 
machines with this property has the important consequence that, considerations of speed 
apart, it is unnecessary to design various new machines to do various computing 
processes. They can all be done with one digital computer, suitably programmed for each 
case. It 'ill be seen that as a consequence of this all digital computers are in a sense 
equivalent. 

# Imitating humans

-  "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true 
that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed 
of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play 
satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?" 


# Issues with a human imitating machine:

- # (1) The Theological Objection  (as opposed from a theological, and not an atheistic, perspective)

"Thinking is a function of man's immortal soul. God has given an immortal soul to every 
man and woman, but not to any other animal or to machines. Hence no animal or 
machine can think. "

I am unable to accept any part of this, but will attempt to reply in theological terms. I 
should find the argument more convincing if animals were classed with men, for there is 
a greater difference, to my mind, between the typical animate and the inanimate than 
there is between man and the other animals. The arbitrary character of the orthodox view 
becomes clearer if we consider how it might appear to a member of some other religious 
community. How do Christians regard the Moslem view that women have no souls? But 
let us leave this point aside and return to the main argument. It appears to me that the 
argument quoted above implies a serious restriction of the omnipotence of the Almighty. 
It is admitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to 
two, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He 
sees fit? We might expect that He would only exercise this power in conjunction with a 
mutation which provided the elephant with an appropriately improved brain to minister to 
the needs of this sort[. An argument of exactly similar form may be made for the case of 
machines. It may seem different because it is more difficult to "swallow." But this really 
only means that we think it would be less likely that He would consider the 
circumstances suitable for conferring a soul. The circumstances in question are discussed 
in the rest of this paper. In attempting to construct such machines we should not be 
irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the 
procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing 
mansions for the souls that He creates. 

- # (2) The "Heads in the Sand" Objection  

"The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful. Let us hope and believe 
that they cannot do so."

- The popularity of the theological argument is clearly connected with this feeling. It is likely to be quite strong in intellectual people, since they value the power of thinking more highly than others, and are more inclined to base their belief in the superiority of Man on this power.

- # (3) The Mathematical Objection 
Godel's theorem ( 1931 ) shows that in any sufficiently powerful logical system statements can be formulated which can neither be proved nor disproved within the system, unless possibly the system itself is inconsistent.
- "Consider the machine specified as follows. . . . Will this machine ever answer 'Yes' 
to any question?" The dots are to be replaced by a description of some machine in a 
standard form.

- I do not think too much importance should be attached to it. We too often give wrong answers to questions ourselves to be justified in being very pleased at such evidence of fallibility on the part of the machines.
