# Gio's Amazing Todo-list

I gave height a try but I didn't particuarily enjoy it. I like to keep things simple, and don't use most of its functionality, so I decided something that I can use within vim is perfect, hate leaving vim anyways :)


- Hacking:
    * md5 calc, note, rsa calc
    * learn the remaining knowledge you need to solve asm.
    * practice writing ROP exploits
    * solve asm
    * learn the remaining knowledge you need to solve asm.

- KMonad
    *  read [this](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/karabiner/#my-personal-karabiner-setup). Try to do something similar with KMonad. Also remap hjkl to arrow keys, and get the caps lock home rebinding done through KMonad, in hope that it fucking loads on startup properly unlike xmodmap alt + q = esc caps lock = home key, home key = caps lock

- Books: 
    * centralize all ebooks in github
    * backup ebooks to phone using git

- General: 
    * Start working towards a "second brain". I really like the idea. Especially inspired by [this guy](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/). 
    * make a reddit post in tmux checking the most vimlike way possible to yank text.
