# Gio's Amazing Todo-list

I gave Height a try but I didn't particuarily enjoy it. I like to keep things simple, and don't use most of its functionality, so I decided something that I can use within vim is perfect, hate leaving vim anyways :)

- Hacking:
   - Classic Binary exploitation: 
        *  note
   - Writing shellcode : 
        + learn the remaining knowledge you need to solve asm.
        + solve asm
        + solve ascii, and asg
   - Kernel vulnrability exploitation:
       * resources!!! ir0nstone thankfully has a section on this.
       * solve syscall
       * solve rootkit
       * softmmu, towelroot, kcrc, exynos
       * [mega thread](https://github.com/xairy/linux-kernel-exploitation?tab=readme-ov-file#practice) thread
   - Heap exploitation
       * 
   - Reverse engineering: (beyond just parsing assembly when given a pwn challenge...)
       * solve aeg
       * find a better source of rev challs
   - Game RE, embedded RE, this is cool, but for the future, maybe in the course?!?!

- Programming: 
    * Either continue your compiler, or your OSdev :)

- KMonad
    *  read [this](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/karabiner/#my-personal-karabiner-setup). Try to do something similar with KMonad. Also remap hjkl to arrow keys, and get the caps lock home rebinding done through KMonad, in hope that it fucking loads on startup properly unlike xmodmap alt + q = esc caps lock = home key, home key = caps lock

- Books: 
    * centralize all ebooks in github
    * backup ebooks to phone using git

- General: 
    * Start working towards a "second brain". I really like the idea. Especially inspired by [this guy](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/).
