# Gio's Amazing Todo-list

I gave height a try but I didn't particuarily enjoy it. I like to keep things simple, and don't use most of its functionality, so I decided something that I can use within vim is perfect, hate leaving vim anyways :)


- Hacking:
    * relearn GOT and PLT properly. Re-solve passcode.
    * solve unexploitable. (on both pwnable.kr and pwnable.tw)
    * learn the remaining knowledge you need to solve asm.
    * solve asm


- Books: 
    * centralize all ebooks in github
    * backup ebooks to phone using git

- General: 
    * Start working towards a "second brain". I really like the idea. Especially inspired by [this guy](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/). 
    * make a reddit post in tmux checking the most vimlike way possible to yank text.
