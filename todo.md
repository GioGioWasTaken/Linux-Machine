# Gio's Amazing Todo-list

I gave height a try but I didn't particuarily enjoy it. I like to keep things simple, and don't use most of its functionality, so I decided something that I can use within vim is perfect, hate leaving vim anyways :)

- Books: 
    * centralize all ebooks in github
    * backup ebooks to phone using git

- Uni-Studying:
    * 2 binary tree follow-code questions
    * full test (2024 July)

- Hacking:
    * finish echo2

- General: 
    * Start working towards a "second brain". I really like the idea. Especially inspired by [this guy](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/).
