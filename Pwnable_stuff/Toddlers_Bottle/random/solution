Seemingly, this number is always generated: 0x6B8B4567
binary: 1101011100010110100010101100111

so we need to find the xor compliment for this in order to get 0xdeadbeef

rand: 11011110101011011011111011101111
complement: 0000100111101001011101000011000 (one digit is missing)
0xdeadbeef: 1011110101011011011111011101111
