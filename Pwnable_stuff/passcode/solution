For brevity's sake, we will start the logic from login, though unchronological.
login asks for passcode1-> it takes user input and stores it at the first 8 bytes (int* size) of the uninitiliazed value passcode

login's ebp register is stored in 0xFFFFD518 , so we can deduct that passcode1's correct address is: ebp - 0x4 = 0xFFFFD514,
and passcode2's: ebp-0x8 = 0xFFFFD510
now we can check which values are stored at those addresses.
passcode 1 = 0xFFFFD560
passcode 2 = 0xea2d9b00


GOAL:
set *(EBP -0x10) = 0x528e6
set *(EBP -0xc) = 0xcc07c9

FACT:
EBP -0x10 (-16) = 0xFFFFD508
EBP -0xc (-12)= 0xFFFFD50C


it will jump to :0x804a02c
address of bin/cat call: 0x80485d7
