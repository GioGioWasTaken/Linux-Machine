Once below a fullmoon lit night 

A young priest again preached, ah what a sight

and Dantamiya, who beheld the scene

couldn't help but intervene

and so he brought woe upon the priest

and into the shape of a turtle he turned amiss.

Great Theramesius, Oh So aweful

wept the fate of his disicple, so terrible!

and so when his tears dried and his woe, aside

his rage grew, until yet untried

Dantimiya who sensed the peril




Dantimiya jealous with the attention and care always given to Theramesius by his followers, and thereby turned once of Theramesius' priests into a turtle. Hearing of his rage, Dantemiya laments his fate and is rescued by the moon, who is in love with him and Theramesius who pities her
