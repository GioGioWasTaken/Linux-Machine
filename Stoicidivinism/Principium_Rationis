Principium Rationis

Mankind is driven by neither rationale nor emotion

To take blame in the actions of a man is reproachable --

for all is controlled by circumstances, and brought upon by the divine and the unfathomable. 

A war might rage on for a millenia, and it is of no consequence whether it is just or unjust

A flower bed much beloved by children and horse is set aflame

and no longer do the birds seek its shelter and warmth

even so do wars stir havoc in the hearts of all

Many a good man slain and many a bad man laugh in scorn

but none are to be blamed for good is not an innate quality

it is the resolution between two forms of life, that thus reads 

"I willst not hurt thou, therefore I beseech thee, do not hurt me". 

It is not by reason or emotion that we become morale, but by sheer luck of circumstance.

even so, thou must not despair

adhere to whatever thou might like, and let this one line be your guidance

Do No Harm.
