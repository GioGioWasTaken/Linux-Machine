\textbf{Definition:} Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. Two continuous maps $f, g : X \to Y$ are said to be \textit{homotopic} if there exists a continuous map 
\[
H : X \times [0, 1] \to Y
\]
such that for all $x \in X$, 
\[
H(x, 0) = f(x) \quad \text{and} \quad H(x, 1) = g(x).
\]
The map $H$ is called a \textit{homotopy} between $f$ and $g$. If such a homotopy exists, we say that $f$ and $g$ are \textit{homotopic}, denoted by $f \simeq g$.
