Yeheli I have a headache and it won't go away so i can't actually study

This is actually so bad, i didn't study yesterday, and i barely studied the day before yesterday, as well as the day before that one.

And I am doing this instead of trying to study anyway ;-;


anyways, enjoy


In a parallel circuit with resistors \( R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n \), the total resistance \( R_{\text{tot}} \) is given by:

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{tot}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n}
\]

Let \( R_{\text{min}} \) be the smallest resistance among \( R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n \). Since all resistances \( R_i \) are positive, each term \( \frac{1}{R_i} \) is positive. Therefore:

\[
\frac{1}{R_i} \geq \frac{1}{R_{\text{min}}} \text{ for all } i
\]

Summing these inequalities gives:

\[
\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n} \geq \frac{n}{R_{\text{min}}}
\]

Since the total resistance \( \frac{1}{R_{\text{tot}}} \) is the sum of these reciprocals:

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{tot}}} \geq \frac{1}{R_{\text{min}}}
\]

However, this sum is always greater than the reciprocal of the smallest resistance:

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{tot}}} > \frac{1}{R_{\text{min}}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides (which reverses the inequality):

\[
R_{\text{tot}} < R_{\text{min}}
\]

Thus, the total resistance \( R_{\text{tot}} \) in a parallel circuit is always less than the smallest resistance \( R_{\text{min}} \) among the resistors.
