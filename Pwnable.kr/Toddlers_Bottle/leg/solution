1. main:
entrance sequence, printf, scanf...
into r4, return value of key1
into r3, return value of key2
then: r4= r4+ r3
into r3, return value of key3

then: r2= r4+r3


our final value is r2. to know its value we just have to add the total that r0 of each of the key functions, adds to.


KEY 1:

R0 = PC = 0x00008ce0 +0x4

KEY 2:

R0 = PC+0x4 = 0x00008d06 + 0x4 + 0x2 (two instruction ahead!)

KEY 3:

R0 = lr = 0x00008d80


Conclusion:
PC points two instructions after the current instruction. 


solution: 108400
