# Goal: 
RCE

# Primitives
- After setting a key, we are allowed to use the encrypt and decrypt functions. We cannot set a key and then unset it. We can set a key, encrypt, and then set a new key.
-  The encrypt function asks for data up to 1024 bytes, and supposedly exits if you provide data shorter then the size you gave it. In actuality this does not happen.

# Approach:


# Misc notes:
