# Goal: 
RCE

# Primitives / Bugs
I have seperated usable bugs(primitives) and other bugs

## Bugs:
1. Segfault when giving the menu no input (0 or -1)
2. p and q get a format string `%d` despite their size being _int16, causing them to overflow into each other at each `scanf` call.
3. After setting a key, we are allowed to use the encrypt and decrypt functions. We cannot set a key and then unset it. `We can set a key, encrypt, and then set a new key.`

## Primitives:

- `RSA_encrypt` has an overflow
- `RSA_decrypt` has a `FSB`. 

# Approach:

Leak canary, and write a rop chain with `system` which we have the `.plt` for. No need for a leak.
