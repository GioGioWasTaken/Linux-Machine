we will overwrite the return address of fsb
it is stored at offset 76 from our stack leak
we convinetely get 4 different calls to printf
we can use each call to overwrite one of the 4 bytes that make up the return address, to redirect code execution
all we have to do is pad(remember little endian)
we will do it in 2 writes, since %n was built for ints, and the smallest int specifier is %hn.
%[LSB in decimal]x%19
%[LSB+1 in decimal]x

continue tomorrow! :)
