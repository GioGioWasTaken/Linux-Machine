I am feeling unwell so i really hope this makes sense and isn't gibberrish:

# Primitives:

- a write of 1295 bytes

# restrictions:

- NX
- ASLR

# Approach: 

With NX and ASLR enabled, I was left thinking about `ret2plt`, but we don't have a puts call. Well, perhaps we can use the read itself as a rop gadget, and modify register values with other rop gadgets, such that the read, actually leaks an address from memory.
