# Primitives:

- a write of 1295 bytes

# restrictions:

- NX
- ASLR

# Approach: 

With NX and ASLR enabled, I was left thinking about `ret2plt`, but we don't have a puts call. Well, perhaps we can use the read itself as a rop gadget, and modify register values with other rop gadgets, such that the read, actually leaks an address from memory.
=======
```C
#include <stdio.h>
void main(){
	// no brute forcing
	sleep(3);
	int buf[4];
	read(0, buf, 1295);
}

```

# Constraints :

- NX, ASLR, not bruteforceable

# Approach : 

This is a ROP challenge.
