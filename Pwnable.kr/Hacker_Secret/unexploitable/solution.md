I am feeling unwell so i really hope this makes sense and isn't gibberrish:

# Primitives:

- a write of 1295 bytes

# restrictions:

- NX
- ASLR

# Gadgets available:

Control over RBP and RBX


# Approach: 

At first, I tried finding any gadgets that use direct memory locations with [], so that they dereference my address for me, indirectly giving me control to that address, without a leak.  But none of the gadgets available to me gave me this.


Then, upon some googling,  I discovered SROP. We can control the RAX value indirectly, since it holds the amount of characters read by read(). Which means, we can trigger SROP by utilizing this in combination with a syscall gadget.
